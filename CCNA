In This repository we do some basic configuration of router interfaces, so let just being..
1- First of all we need to open our packet traser.
2- Then we need go in the bottom left select network devices and drag router to the white screen. 
3- After that we need to create a lan environment by adding a switch and Pcs in it.
4- After that we need to connect the router with the switch and with the PCS too.
5- Now wo start the basic configuration of Router After that we do swicth interface configuration.
6- Code for Router:
Router>en
Router#config tc
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z	
Router(config)#do show ip interface brief
Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol 
GigabitEthernet0/0/0   unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down 
GigabitEthernet0/0/1   unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down 
GigabitEthernet0/0/2   unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down 
Vlan1                  unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down
Router(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/0/0
Router(config-if)#ip address 172.168.255.254  255.255.0.0
Router(config-if)#speed 1000
Router(config-if)#duplex full
Router(config-if)# no shutdown

Router(config-if)#
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0, changed state to up

Router(config-if)#do show ip interface brief
Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol 
GigabitEthernet0/0/0   172.168.255.254 YES manual up                    down 
GigabitEthernet0/0/1   unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down 
GigabitEthernet0/0/2   unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down 
Vlan1                  unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down
Router(config-if)#








Router con0 is now available

7- In this you can see first get in the privileged exact mode then we go to the global configuration mode. After that we use a commamd to show the IP interfaces and the Ip interfaces are all 
down because we didnt add the IP, then we add the IP address 172.168.255.254 (thats the Lan IP). 
8- After that we set the speed of the interface 1000.
9- In the last we set the status up in the interface 
10- We do this configuration Manually :)
